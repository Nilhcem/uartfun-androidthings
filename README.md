# Android Things UART fun

A simple project demonstrating what you can do with Android Things, a Rainbow HAT, and a USB-TTL cable.

## Demo

See this tweet for a demo video:

## Required stuff

- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- UART cable (e.g. PL2303HX)
- Rainbow HAT


## Setup

- Connect the Rainbow HAT on the Raspberry Pi, the UART cable TX wire to the Rainbow HAT RX pin, and the UART cable RX wire to the Rainbow HAT TX pin
- By default the UART port is mapped to the linux console, disable this behaviour mounting the Raspberry Pi micro sd *(wherein Android Things is installed)* on your host computer, then edit `/path/to/mnt/sdcard/cmdline.txt` to remove the following kernel boot argument:
```
console=serial0,115200
```
- Put back the sd card into the Raspberry Pi, turn it on, deploy the application
- Plug the UART cable into a host PC, start your favorite terminal program (e.g. screen, cutecom), and connect to the USB-TTL port at 115200 baud.
```
$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```
- Now you can start sending commands from your host keyboard

Note: if you are on android things 0.2-devpreview, you should not remove the `console=serial0,115200` argument but replace it by `console=tty0,115200`
